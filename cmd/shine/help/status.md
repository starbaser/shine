# shine status

Display current state of all panel supervisors and their managed prisms.

Queries all running prismctl panel supervisors via IPC to show which panel is running, foreground prism (actively displayed), background prisms (suspended), and per-prism state.

## USAGE

shine status
```

## FLAGS

## OUTPUT

$ shine start && shine status
