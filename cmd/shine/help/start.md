# shine start

Start the shinectl service manager and all enabled panels.

If shinectl is already running, this command reports success without taking action.

## USAGE

```bash
shine start
```

## FLAGS

```text
--help   Show help for command
```

## BEHAVIOR

When shinectl starts, it:
- Reads configuration from ~/.config/shine/prism.toml
- Spawns Kitty panels for each enabled prism via remote control
- Launches prismctl supervisors to manage prism lifecycle
- Creates IPC sockets in /run/user/{uid}/shine/ for communication

## EXAMPLES

```bash
$ shine start
```

```bash
$ shine start && shine status
```

## LEARN MORE
  Use `shine help status` to check running panels.
  Use `shine help logs` to view service logs.
  Config file: ~/.config/shine/prism.toml
