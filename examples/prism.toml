# Example prism.toml - Unified Prism Configuration
#
# This file uses the SAME structure as [prisms.*] sections in shine.toml,
# with the addition of [metadata] for prism information.
#
# Can be used in THREE ways:
#
# 1. Full Package (directory with binary):
#    ~/.config/shine/prisms/weather/
#    ├── prism.toml          # This file
#    ├── shine-weather       # Binary included
#    └── assets/             # Optional assets
#
# 2. Data Directory (directory without binary):
#    ~/.config/shine/prisms/spotify/
#    ├── prism.toml          # This file
#    └── config.json         # Prism-specific data
#    # Binary "shine-spotify" found via PATH
#
# 3. Standalone Config:
#    ~/.config/shine/prisms/clock.toml  # Just this file
#    # Binary "shine-clock" found via PATH

# === Core Identification ===
name = "weather"
version = "1.0.0"
path = "shine-weather"  # Binary name or path

# === Runtime Behavior (Defaults - User can override in shine.toml) ===
enabled = true
anchor = "top-right"
width = "400px"
height = "30px"
position = "0,0"

# === Margins ===
margin_top = 0
margin_right = 160  # Offset from clock
margin_bottom = 0
margin_left = 0

# === Behavior ===
hide_on_focus_loss = false
focus_policy = "not-allowed"
output_name = "DP-2"

# === Metadata (ONLY meaningful in prism sources) ===
# Metadata is prism identification/description, not user configuration
# During merge, metadata ALWAYS comes from prism source
# Any metadata in shine.toml [prisms.*] is ignored during merge
[metadata]

# User can override any setting (except metadata) in ~/.config/shine/shine.toml:
#
# [prisms.weather]
# enabled = true          # Override: enable the prism
# width = "500px"         # Override: make it wider
# margin_right = 200      # Override: adjust position
# # All other settings inherited from this prism.toml
